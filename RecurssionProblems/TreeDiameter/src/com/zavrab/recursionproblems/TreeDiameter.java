/**
 * Diameter of a Tree:
 * We are given a tree. The tree is not necessarily a binary tree. Each edge of the tree has a positive number associated with it,
 * a distance between the nodes it connects. The distance between any two nodes in the tree is defined as the sum of distances of the edges
 * that make the path between them. The diameter of the tree is defined as the distance between the two most distant nodes.
 * We are asked to find the diameter of the node.
 *
 * We observe that the diameter of a tree can be achieved in two different ways. The first is when the diameter path goes through the root.
 * In that case the diameter will be the sum of distances between the root and the two most distant leaves in two different
 * subtrees of the the root. If the root has only one subtree the root itself will be the end point of that path.
 * In the second way the diameter path doesnâ€™t go through the root. In that case the diameter of the root will be the diameter of one of its sons.
 * The diameter of the tree is the maximum achieved by those two ways. The recursive call should return two values
 * the diameter of the sub tree and the distance between the root and the most distant leaf in that tree.
